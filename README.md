My course work for the course [Zero to Mastery - PyTorch for Deep Learning](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/learn-pytorch/) with references to original material and my personalized notes and content.

PS: The notebooks offered in the original repo has been modified to reflect my learningas well as accomodating for my local enfironment. I am running the content on Google Colab powered by my local Jupyter Notebook server. Also, I am running on Apple M1 Pro Macbook Pro 2021 with TensorFlow version `2.8.0`. For the milestone projects, because certain features on TensorFlow have not yet been implemented for Apple Silicon, I am using the Collab GPU and in my region I have only been able to get the `Tesla P100` GPU.
